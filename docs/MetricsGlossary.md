## Organization
An organization is a team of collaborators and contributors, along with project repositories. An organizational account allows people to become members and collaborate on the repositories it contains. Members can assume different roles with varying responsibilities and abilities.

### DSACMS
**Digital Services at CMS**. The digital services and initiatives managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to enhance their digital platforms and services.

### CMS-Enterprise
Repositories related to the operations of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 

### CMSgov
Open Source repositories released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

### Enterprise-CMCS
Center for Medicaid & CHIP Services.

## Repository
Also known as “repo,” a repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation) and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

## Metrics 
Measurable data points that help visualize and analyze contributions and interactions within GitHub Repositories (projects). Metrics can provide insights into the activity, health, and engagement of a repository.

## Issues
Issues are a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, and discussions or feedback in a repository. Analyzing the number of open vs. closed issues helps gauge project progress and team workload.

## Commits
Commits are individual changes made to the codebase. Each commit includes a unique ID, a message describing the change, and a timestamp. Tracking commits helps understand how frequently changes are made and how active development is.

## Pull Requests (PRs)
Pull requests are a way to propose changes to a codebase. When a developer wants to merge their changes from a branch into another (typically the main branch), they create a PR. This facilitates code review and discussion before the changes are merged. Metrics like the number of open vs. closed PRs, average time to merge, and comments can reveal the efficiency of the review process and team collaboration.

## Forks
Forks are copies of a repository that allow users to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. They are commonly used for developing features or fixes that can later be submitted back to the original repository via pull requests. A high number of forks can indicate community interest and the potential for external contributions, showcasing the project's relevance and usability.

## Stars
Stars are a way for users to show appreciation for a repository. A star can be thought of as a "like" or "bookmark," indicating that a user finds the project interesting or useful. The number of stars can be a metric for a project's popularity or perceived value.

## Watchers
Watchers are users who subscribe to updates for a repository. They receive notifications about discussions, issues, and commits. The number of watchers can indicate how many people are actively interested in the project's progress.

## Followers
Watchers are users who subscribe to updates for an organization's public activity(new repositories, discussions...).

## Diff
Diff refers to the difference in metrics such as issues, commits, or PRs between this week and last week. It highlights changes in contributions or activity over time.

## % Diff
% Diff represents the percentage change in a given metric (like issues, commits, or PRs) compared to the previous week. It provides a quick view of growth or decline, helping teams assess their activity levels and project health over time.


# Terms In the Metrics Repository 

## OSPO
**Open Source Program Office**. A department or team within an organization that manages and oversees open source software initiatives, including contributions, compliance, and community engagement.

## Feature Branch
A feature branch is a separate branch in a version control system (like Git) used to develop a new feature or make changes to the project. It allows developers to work on features independently of the main codebase and merge changes back once the feature is complete.

## Hotfix
A quick and immediate fix applied to a live production environment to address a critical issue or bug. Hotfixes are usually implemented outside the regular release cycle to minimize downtime and resolve urgent problems.

## PEP8
**Python Enhancement Proposal 8**. A style guide for Python code that outlines conventions for writing clean and readable Python code. It includes recommendations on formatting, naming conventions, and code structure.

## Linting
The process of running a program (a linter) that analyzes source code to identify potential errors, stylistic issues, and code quality problems. Linting helps maintain code quality and consistency across a project.

## Eleventy
A simple and flexible static site generator. It allows developers to build static websites using various template languages and provides tools for customizing and optimizing static site builds.
