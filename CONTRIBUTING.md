# How to Contribute

We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of
the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just
ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is
you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly
contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
[LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

### Getting Started

To collect metrics, first make sure you have set the following environment variables:
    - GITHUB_TOKEN - The github api key that you are using to collect data
    - AUGUR_HOST - The api domain corresponding to an instance of [CHAOSS/Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/)

Then, install the dependencies in requirements.txt.

Once the env is set up, either run the 'update data' GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/update_data.yml` or execute the `update.sh` shell script.

To run the server, make sure that your computer has npm installed.
Once npm is installed run `npm install` and `npm start` in the app/ directory.

### Team Specific Guidelines
- Please try to keep pull requests to a reasonable size; try to split large contributions to multiple PRs
- Please create pull requests into dev unless the contribution is some kind of bugfix or urgent hotfix.
- Document and explain the contribution clearly according to provided standards when possible.
- Feel free to reach out to us if there is any confusion.

### Building dependencies

1. Clone the repo

    `git clone https://github.com/DSACMS/metrics.git`

2. Install the required packages in requirements.txt (preferably in a virtual env)

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
    
3. Install node dependencies

    `cd app && npm install && cd ..`

### Building the Project

To collect metrics, first make sure you have set the following environment variables:
    - GITHUB_TOKEN - The github api key that you are using to collect data
    - AUGUR_HOST - The api domain corresponding to an instance of [CHAOSS/Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/)

Once the env is set up, either run the 'update data' GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/update_data.yml` or execute the `update.sh` shell script.

To run the server, run `npm install` and `npm start` in the app/ directory.

### Workflow and Branching

We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

1.  Fork the project 
2.  Check out the `main` branch 
3.  Create a feature branch
4.  Write code and tests for your change 
5.  From your branch, make a pull request against `dev` if you have a feature change and `main` if it is a hotfix 
6.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed and resolve git history if needed
7.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `dev` and later released into `main`
8.  Delete your feature branch

### Testing Conventions

This project uses pytest as the main testing framework for the project's cli. 

Python tests can be found in the `scripts/tests`. Any new testing
contributions are greatly appreciated and needed to ensure quality of any interpreted
language project. 

### Coding Style and Linters

This project adheres to PEP8 rules and guidelines whenever possible when accepting
new contributions of Python code. Although, there are good reasons to ignore particular guidelines
in particular situations. Further information on PEP8 can be found [here.](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

This project utilizes pylint as the primary linter for backend code, while eslint and prettier handle code formatting and linting for the frontend. Checks are implemented upon new pull requests into protected branches to ensure code quality and consistency.

Python code quality checks are extremely useful for lowering the
cost of maintenence of Python projects. Further information on Pylint can be found [here.](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Issues

When creating an issue please try to adhere to the following format:

    module-name: One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)

    ### Expected behavior

    As concisely as possible, describe the expected behavior.

    ### Actual behavior

    As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior.

    ### Steps to reproduce the behavior

    List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behavior.

    see our .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md for more examples.

### Writing Pull Requests

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80
columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

    module-name: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

    Problem

    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
    thought of being the motivation for your change.

    Solution

    Describe the modifications you've done.

    Result

    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

* Describe what was done; not the result 
* Use the active voice 
* Use the present tense 
* Capitalize properly 
* Do not end in a period — this is a title/subject 
* Prefix the subject with its scope

## Reviewing Pull Requests

The repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at
github.cms.gov. For the most part this process should be transparent to the
project users, but it does have some implications for how pull requests are
merged into the codebase.

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project
community (both inside and outside of github.cms.gov), and once the changes are
approved, your commits will be brought into github.cms.gov's internal system for
additional testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed
back to GitHub with the next sync.

This process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way.
Instead a member of the project team will post a message in the pull request
thread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull
request will be closed.

The changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the
authorship metadata will be preserved.

## Documentation

We also welcome improvements to the project [documentation](docs/Main.md) or to the existing
docs. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/DSACMS/metrics/issues/new).
